Introduction
==============

This is the documentation for discord-class-commands, an extension for discord.py
that provides a class-based approach to creating Discord application commands.

Prerequisites
---------------

discord-class-commands works with Python 3.8 or higher. Support for earlier versions of Python
is not provided. Python 2.7 or lower is not supported. Python 3.7 or lower is not supported.

The extension requires v2.0 or higher of discord.py (or a discord.py-compatible fork) to be installed.


.. _installing:

Installing
-----------

You can get the library directly from PyPI: ::

    python3 -m pip install -U discord-class-commands

If you are using Windows, then the following should be used instead: ::

    py -3 -m pip install -U discord-class-commands

We recommend also installing discord.py at this point.

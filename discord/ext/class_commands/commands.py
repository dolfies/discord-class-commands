        Parameters
        ------------
        content: Optional[:class:`str`]
            The content of the message to send.
        tts: :class:`bool`
            Indicates if the message should be sent using text-to-speech.

        files: List[:class:`~discord.File`]
            A list of files to upload. Must be a maximum of 10.
        nonce: :class:`int`
            The nonce to use for sending this message. If the message was successfully sent,

        allowed_mentions: :class:`~discord.AllowedMentions`
            Controls the mentions being processed in this message. If this is
            passed, then the object is merged with :attr:`~discord.Client.allowed_mentions`.
            The merging behaviour only overrides attributes that have been explicitly passed
            to the object, otherwise it uses the attributes set in :attr:`~discord.Client.allowed_mentions`.
            If no object is passed at all then the defaults given by :attr:`~discord.Client.allowed_mentions`
            are used instead.
        view: :class:`discord.ui.View`
            A Discord UI View to add to the message.
        embeds: List[:class:`~discord.Embed`]
            A list of embeds to upload. Must be a maximum of 10.
        suppress_embeds: :class:`bool`
            Whether to suppress embeds for the message. This sends the message without any embeds if set to ``True``.
        ephemeral: :class:`bool`
            Indicates if the message should only be visible to the user who started the interaction.
            If a view is sent with an ephemeral message and it has no timeout set then the timeout
            is set to 15 minutes.

        Raises
        --------
